Dear UML, OCL, Papyrus user,

this work aims at providing researchers with a set of 33 OCL consistency rules. The 33 OCL rules were systematically collected in [1], 
and they are a subset of 52 consistency rules which the experts in the field of Model Driven Software Engineering considered should 
always be enforced in all UML models [2].

How to cite this work?
If you use these rules (either in Plain English or in OCL), please, cite it. You can do so by referring to the following publications:

1) If you use the entire set of 116 UML consistency rules in plain English, please reference to:
   D. Torre, Y. Labiche, M. Genero, and M. Elaasar. 2018. (in press) A systematic identification of consistency rules for UML diagrams, Journal of Systems and Software.

2) If you use one of the 33 rules either in English or in their OCL version, please reference to:

Thank you,
